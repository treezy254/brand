## 3-2-1 for Reddit:

**3** posts that *give value to the subreddit*
→ tutorials, frameworks, case studies, benchmark screenshots, teardown threads
→ but NOT “thought leadership” tone — more “here’s something cool I discovered”

**2** comments that “give social proof / wins / positivity”
→ instead of “proud” content (LinkedIn style)
→ you comment on others’ threads with helpful detail + real numbers if possible
→ that builds karma, trust, and gets you recognized

**1** very soft CTA or brand tie-in
→ not a promo post — that gets downvoted
→ instead: “here’s a free tool I’m building to make X easier — AMA / feedback welcome”

Reddit **loves**:
– “I’m building something — want feedback?”
– “here’s my real data graph — what does it mean?”
– “here’s exactly how I solved this bottleneck, code included”

Reddit **hates**:
– “check out my brand”
– polished marketing language
– stealth selling

### So the “Reddit 3-2-1” rewrite looks like:

**3** helpful *posts*
**2** meaningful *comments*
**1** transparent *build-in-public update*
