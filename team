Prioritizing your efforts

Filters: qualitative [new, brand, global, simple] and Qualitative [Net present value, Internal rate of return, total growth rate of org]

---

Matching priortities and resources

Rank priorities from high to low
look at resources and then look how deep you can get into that list with the resources that you have
appropriate mix of type of initiative advancing as more goals as possible
Document which resources to get an initiative done
review resource pool abd allocate resources. Allocate resources fully to iniatives top down until resources run out, and then draw a line and hold it.



---

Setting goals:
	commit goal: a promise to the organization that you will absolutely deliver without fail
		* Needs to feel attainable
		* Need to feel obligated to deliver
		* Have to be consequences for missing [no bonus, no raise, reduced responsibilities, in some cases reassignment out of the organization]

	stretch goal: a nice to have. If everything goes great, and we get a little bit lucky, we can hit that number. We are not sure how we will get ther, but it'd be great if we do. 

		* Should be big and audacious. People should be uncomfortable when you give them that stretch.
		* No negative consequences. needs to be pure upside, and if they capture any part of it, there is a reward for doing so

	---

	think about the two types of goals, get your high performing team to articulate goals that commit and why they think its a fair commitment in terms of what they deliver to the organization, and then lay out that really big, really exciting stretch, where its not quite clear how they'll get there, and it will take a lot of hard work, dedication, and collaboration between your team members to achieve it, and then pay your people accordingly when they do.

Executing the plan

Making decisions:
	Prepare to make the decision
	make the decision
	Communicate the decision to other people: what you decided and why
	Execute against that deicison [as a leader, monitor the execution]
	Measure and adjust accoridngly


Decision styles
	Autocratic: one decison makes the call without input from everyne else [small decision, high urgency]
	particpatory: and individual or a small group make the decision, but they get input from other people before making the decision [big decision, high urgency]
	Democratic: all relevant parties in the room, and we vote, majority wins [small decision, low urgency]
	Consensus: everyone involved in the decision has to agree before moving on with the decision [low urgency, big decision]


	---

	urgency
	size of small decision

Personal agendas and politics

- team members should rise above them

savvy: knowing who is nfluential in the organizzation, and getting things done
political: doing something to get ahead personally and playing people often agains one another for your persnal gain

Be mindful of the politics, what the politics are, but don't engage in them. 

simply ask: is the action I'm about to take in the best interest of the organization? Stop it if not, both you and your team.

Measuring and adjsuting

How to run meeting more effeciently, help focus on the right set of metrics, and managing by exception

1. share information ahead of time
	- send documents to people well in advance of the meeting
	- set clear expectation that the information will be reviewed before people come into the room
	- hold people to that standard when they come to the meeting; simply ask, has everyone reviewed the information that was sent out
		:: if enough people have reviewed, rescheduled the meeting for later
		:: set the tone for people that this is an expectation when we send stuff out in advance, it is going to be reviewed so that we can be efficient with our time when we work together. 

2. Define the meeting's purpose and ensure the right people are prepared with the information they need and will be in attendance. 

3. Only talk about major variances and focus on metrics that are out of line. Forget all the ones that are meeting expectations and think about how you can solve for the variances that are appearing.

4. Use the 80/20 rule : 

5. Review your standing meeting: is the meeting still serving its purpose. if not, stop it.

6. If a decision is to be made, let everyone who was in the meeting knows what was decided, and immediately communicate the decision to the rest of the organization.

Empowering people

Setting direction, but get out of the way and let them run

concept of lanes:
	- set a direction for a team member saying the goal is here, and here are the bounderies within which you can operate, but its up to you to decide how you get from here upto that goal
	- You'll also have to accept that there are different ways of doing things and a team member may take an approach that you fundamentally disagree with, and a measure of a good leader, is to be willing to step back and say, "hey, I think you may be going the wrong way, here is a different way to think about it, but ultimately its up to you to how you want to proceed, and the goal is the same, let me know what you need from me to be successful."

	- You have to let go of that agenda, and give them the resources then get out of their way.
